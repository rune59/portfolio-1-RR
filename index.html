                    <p>I am going to be a web developer. I'm studying front-end development at Noroff. So now
                        there are 2 years left before I finish.

                        I have been programming for a long time, but to varying
                        degrees over the years. I took a master's degree in computer
                        science in adulthood. Also that part-time, such as this study.

                        I like the creativity of creating
                        websites. It gives vent to the imagination.

                        Below you can study three of the projects I have worked on at Noroff in the last 2 years.

                            The blog website uses WordPress as a headless CMS. The website uses the API from the
                            installation of WordPress to
                            retrieve data.

                            Home page contains a carousel, programmed in JavaScript.

                <h1 class="heading-title">Some more words about me</h1>
                <p>
                    Some people think that web development is an art, others think that it depends on thorough planning.
                    I think both are a bit right.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I also think it's about recognizing patterns. And the more you work with web development, the more
                    familiar you become
                    with the most common ways of doing things.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A web developer has to study a lot of theory and documentation, but it is also important to be able
                    to link
                    theory to the practical
                    implementation of a task.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Programming is a way to keep my brain in shape. And I am never finished learning.
                    There is a saying that when you consider yourself fully educated and know everything, you are not
                    fully educated, but
                    finished, in the sense that you are ready for retirement. There is always something new to learn.
                    There are age limits and legal regulations for retirement, but not for developing websites.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I'm looking for someone who will hire me. Or someone I can work for as a freelance web developer.
                    In that context, an important issue is if and how to fit into a work environment with other
                    colleagues. I have an informal and unpretentious appearance. I do
                    not wear a dark suit and tie at work, but prefer sneakers and everyday clothes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I hardly fit into
                    formal or deeply
                    hierarchical organizations, because I tend to "kick up", not down or sideways. Poor bad bosses. Or
                    lucky
                    employees, if I'm the boss.I prefer a flat organizational structure
                    where there is a short distance from idea to decision, and where one's voice and opinion are easily
                    heard.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It is not so uncommon for prejudice against age in working life in general. Possibly in the IT
                    industry
                    in particular.
                    One can sometimes get the impression that the employee should be 25 years old and have 20 years of
                    experience. I suspect that such
                    prejudices
                    often stem from the
                    employer wanting to shape the employee in his culture, whatever it may be. Well, I'm who I am and I
                    intend to remain who I am. I'm
                    probably not very
                    malleable and I do not want to be streamlined. I'm too individualistic to pretend to be someone
                    other than who I am. I will leave that to those who are going to be film actors. So if you have such
                    wishes for me, sorry, then you
                    are
                    hardly an employer
                    for me.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I want working conditions with reason to believe in an inclusive and good working
                    environment where I am accepted and respected for the way I behave. And where the intrigue and
                    backbiting is unknown.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have am unpretentious sense of humor which is reflected in the fact that I do not take myself or
                    others so seriously. I am easy going and easy to work with. I do not give up so easily when I
                    encounter technical problems. I like to finish work I have started.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I prefer to spend my free time with my family.
                    I like to take walks in nature, in the woods, by bike, or on a trip to mountain peaks. Or fishing
                    from a rowboat or pull a fishing net.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If any of what I have written about myself appeals, then you are welcome to hire me as a
                    permanent employee or freelance employee.
                    If so, I look forward to hearing from you.
