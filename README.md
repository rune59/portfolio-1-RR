# How To Use
The user of the program only needs to relate to the menu on the black bar at the top of each screen. 

There is only one web page (index.html). The top menu has three choices: 
- Projects 
- About
- Contact 

Each project has its own card. Each card has the following information elements:
- Project name
- Screenshot from the project
- Link to the project on Github
- Link to the project on Netlify

The cursor changes appearance to a pointer when hovered over the Github and Netlify icon.
The same goes for sending me an email and accessing my profile on Facebook.

# Acknowledgments
Many thanks to teachers and fellow students at Noroff who have been helpful in solving problems along the way.


An important purpose of this project has been to learn to document development work in a proper way:
- Create README.md for all three projects, as well as for this portfolio project
- Get to know and edit my Github account
